# ITLog
## _The Irresistible Technical Event Logs_

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5.<br>
This project was made to serve as the event logger for users of the team's domain system. The version releases are [here](https://github.com/bossbuwi/itlog/releases). Current version is 0.2-dev. This project is just the frontend for an event logging app. For this to function completely, a compatible backend that serves data through a REST API must be used. The recommended backend provider is (bilog)[https://github.com/bossbuwi/bilog].
